<b>Stochastic Models Used</b><br>
Poisson | Gamma renewal processes | Weibull | Lognormal | Normal Double Exponential | ETAS | Brownian Passage Time<br>

<b>Stage 1</b>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-Determine regional constraints on aggregate fault motions from geodetic measurements<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-Map faults and fault segments<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-Estimate the slip on each fault segment principally from paleoseismic data<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-Determine for each segment a 'flip factor' the extent to which long-term slip on the segment is accomodated aseismically<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-Model uncertainty in fault segments length, widths, and slip factors as independent Caussian random variables with mean 0.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-Draw a set of fault segment dimensions and slip factors at random from that probability distribution<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-Identify ways in which segments of each fault can rupture separately and together. Each combination of segments is a 'seismic &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;source'<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-Determine the extent to which long-term fault slip is accommodated by rupture of each combination of segments for each fault.<br>

<b>Natural Disaster Models</b>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-Natural disasters are treated like 'casino games' with probabilities <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i.e. Urn Model<br>
